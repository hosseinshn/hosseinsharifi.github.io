It is my pleasure to share that I successfully defended my PhD thesis today. I worked on transfer learning in drug response prediction for five amazing years. I feel very happy and satisfied with my journey. I would like to thank my supervisors Martin Ester and Colin Collins, PhD for endless support, inspiring me, keeping me focused, and believing in me especially when I had no faith in myself. I also would like to thank my examining committee Maxwell Libbrecht and Joseph Lehár for sharing their insights about our work and giving me many interesting ideas to work on them in the future. Stay tuned for the next journey... :)

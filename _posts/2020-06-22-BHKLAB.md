Today, I started my research internship at BHK LAB in Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto. I am very excited to learn from one of the leading teams on pharmacogenomics in the world.

I am going to work with Dr. Benjamin Haibe-Kains and his team to propose a rigorous guideline for machine learning in pharmacogenomics.

Unfortunately, due to the sperad of COVID-19, this position will be remotely until the end of Fall 2020.

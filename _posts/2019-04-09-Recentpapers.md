Finally, my first papers during my Ph.D. got accepted! First, my work in collaboration with GenomeDx Inc. got accepted at Recomb-CCB 2019, and then my work on precision medicine got accepted at ISMB/ECCB 2019. I am feeling so happy and excited. Especial thanks to all of the co-authors for their valuable contributions.  You can read them on my GoogleScholar page under the Resources tab.

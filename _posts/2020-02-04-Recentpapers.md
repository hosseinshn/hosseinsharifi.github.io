Our most recent preprint is out! AITL: Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning with input and output space adaptation for pharmacogenomics

We proposed a method that adapts the gene expression of cell lines and patients and measures of the drug response between them in an end-to-end fashion. AITL utilizes adversarial learning to adapt the input space and multi-task learning to adapt the output space. The motivation behind AITL is that cell lines and patients are very different because of basic biology and different approaches to assess drug response in them. AITL is the first method that can address both input and output spaces discrepancies.

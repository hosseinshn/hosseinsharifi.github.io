Recently, I send a lot of emails to authors of papers related to my research about different things from basic fundamental questions to request for code or implementation issues. Believe it or not, in one day I exchanged 14 emails with an author regarding the reproducibility of his results. This teaches me a lesson to always support my published work even if it was for a couple of years ago. I would like to thank all the responsive authors out there! See my Twitter for some examples.

Welcome to my website!
My name is Hossein Sharifi-Noghabi. I was born and raised in a city named Mashhad, in northeast of Iran. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University and Vancouver Prostate Centre in 2021. My main focus is to develop/apply state-of-the-art robust learning systems using transfer learning, adversarial learning, multi-task learning, and domain generalization. During my Ph.D. I worked on transfer learning in precision oncology and pharmacogenomics. Between 2021 and 2022, I was at Novartis under AI4Life Residency Program where I worked on machine learning for data integration on SomaScan proteomics data in collaboration with Data42 and the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research (NIBR).
